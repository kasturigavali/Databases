# Databases


## Executive Summary

In this project we have taken over an existing database to understand its structure and model to create a better and refined database as required. We have improvised and recreated our own database by looking at existing database and applying database optimization techniques like normalization and looking at execution plan for bottlenecks. The data have been migrated to new schema without any loss of functionality or loss of any data from source database. 

We have given a detailed business understanding, data understanding, logical understanding and a few more details about how we have taken over a complex database and made it easier for our users. The target users in our case are: 
•	Sales Executive
•	Marketing Analysts 
•	Manager (upper management)

We have taken in consideration for our users and their needs and created the database views to give database access to the business entities in secured manner.
